# -Cisco-Network-Specialist-Design-Security-VLANS
A university network was built using a Multilayer Switch and nine VLANs (10-90) with 802.1q trunking. Extended ACLs were implemented to secure Financial access (Office only) and limit IT presence (one PC/department). QoS set a 50 Mbps bandwidth cap on Lecture VLANs, and WPA2-PSK/AES secured all wireless access points.
